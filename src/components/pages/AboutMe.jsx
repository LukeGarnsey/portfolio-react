      <p>
      I am a Full Stack Developer who loves building fully featured applications. I specialize in the MERN stack and have built applications in many different languages. With over a decade of experience I create code, pixel art, and music (of all sorts). If not making games, I could be golfing or hanging out with my Shih-Tzu.
